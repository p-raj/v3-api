Process Schema Spec (PSSpec)
------

Currently the PSSpec resembles [CoreAPI] a lot.
The difference is the PSSpec is a subset of a CoreAPI.
i.e It only focuses on one URL/Link of the CoreAPI schema.

It is a JSON document with the following keys:

 - `host`
 - `url`
 - `name`
 - `action`
 - `fields`
